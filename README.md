## User Stroy (sender)

As a user I would like to be able to send stuff from point A to B with minimal constrain (cut of time).

When I enter in the dimension of the package, quantity, pick up location, drop off location and the time frame.
Then I get a quote
When I accept the quote
Then the info get push to the Driver UI.
When a Driver is assigned
Then I get notification.
When the Item get delivered
Then I get notification.


## User Stroy (Driver)

As a driver I would like to earn some extra Cash during my free time.

When I sign in to the Driver Page
Then I see a list of Delivery
When I choose the suitable Delivery (depending on the sender constrain I can potentially choose multiple job)
Then a notification get send to the sender (with ETA if possible)
When the item got delivered 
Then I send another notification to the Sender
